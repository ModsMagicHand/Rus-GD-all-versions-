Install geode on your mobile device (you can't download my mod via geode on PC yet). After installing geode, download the Texture Loader mod. Download the file from github and place it in the path: Your device/Android/Media/Com.geode.launcher/config/textureloader/packs/Paste the file. Launch the game and move the texture pack to Aplied. That's it! Enjoy! :)
